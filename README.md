# WeatherPy with Python APIs

Data analysis project using Python, Pandas and APIs to analyze weather conditions all over the world and make a trip itinerary depending on weather preference.


## Overview of Project

In this project, we created a trip itinerary of four cities in Brazil based on weather preferences. We used python and the APIs of Open Weather and Google Maps.

We started with the generation of 2000 random Latitudes and Longitudes. We identified the closest city and get the weather conditions. Then, with Google Maps we plotted our search and the final itinerary, with pop-ups with information of interest.


## Results

The result of this project was the itinerary shown below.

The trip consists of four cities in Brazil that were selected from 2000 random latitudes and longitudes and after filtering the data for weather preference this was the end result.
